## Q1: Which point(s) were new to you?

- The emphasis on **over-communicating** using group channels rather than relying solely on private DMs was new, as it ensures transparency and collective awareness.
- The practice of **joining meetings 5-10 minutes early** to build rapport and understand teammates' schedules stood out.
- The idea of using **structured, in-meeting note sharing** to verify requirements and reduce future miscommunication was an insightful takeaway.

## Q2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- **Effective Communication:** I need to work on clearly explaining issues and providing detailed context when asking for help.
  - **Action Steps:**
    - Practice framing questions with clear problem descriptions and attempted solutions.
    - Use tools like screenshots, code snippets (via GitHub gists), or screen recordings (using Loom) to support my queries.
    - Regularly review and adapt my communication style based on feedback from peers and mentors.
