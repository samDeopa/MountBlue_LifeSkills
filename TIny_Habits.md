## **1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg**

### **Question 1: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea was BJ Fogg's concept of starting with extremely tiny habits, such as flossing just one tooth or doing just one push-up. This illustrates that building habits doesnâ€™t require monumental effort but rather starting small and focusing on consistency.

### **Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.

- **M (Motivation):** Your desire to perform the behavior.
- **A (Ability):** How easy or difficult it is to perform the behavior.
- **P (Prompt):** The cue or trigger that initiates the behavior.

To make habits easier:

1. **Lower the barrier:** Focus on the **A (Ability)** by making the habit small and manageable, like doing one push-up.
2. **Create prompts:** Use natural triggers like brushing your teeth to remind you of your habit.
3. **Motivate yourself:** Celebrate small wins to boost motivation.

### **Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebration is crucial because it wires the habit into your brain by creating a positive emotional association with the action. When you celebrate, dopamine is released, reinforcing the habit. Whatever you celebrate becomes something your brain seeks to repeat.

### **Question 4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most intriguing idea was the concept of compounding improvement. By focusing on improving by just 1% each day, the cumulative effect over a year can lead to remarkable results. Conversely, a 1% decline each day compounds into significant setbacks.

### **Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book emphasizes that true behavior change is identity-based. Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on who you want to become. For example, instead of saying, "I want to run a marathon," say, "I am a runner." Building habits that align with your identity creates sustainable change.

### **Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.**

To make a habit easier:

1. **Reduce friction:** Eliminate obstacles between you and the habit. For example, keep your gym clothes ready.
2. **Prime your environment:** Place cues where they are visible (e.g., keep a water bottle on your desk).
3. **Use the 2-minute rule:** Break the habit into a version that takes less than 2 minutes to start, like reading just one sentence.

### **Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.**

To make a habit harder:

1. **Increase friction:** Add obstacles that slow down or prevent the habit. For example, delete social media apps from your phone.
2. **Make the environment less convenient:** Store unhealthy snacks out of reach.
3. **Use commitment devices:** Limit access to temptations, like locking your credit card away to avoid impulsive purchases.

- **Make it satisfying:** Track daily reading progress on a calendar and reward myself with a small treat at the end of the week.

### **Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps you can take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive, or the response unsatisfying?**

**Habit:** Mindless scrolling on social media.  
**Steps:**

- **Make the cue invisible:** Remove social media apps from the home screen or uninstall them.
- **Make it unattractive:** Set time limits or reminders about the negative impact of excessive screen time.
- **Make it unsatisfying:** Enlist an accountability partner or use an app that tracks and reports screen usage to discourage overuse.
